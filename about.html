			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Harrison Lew. I attend Abraham Lincoln High School, and enjoy participating in both the classical and jazz band. I've lived my entire life in San Francisco, and lived with my brother until he recently left for UC Irvine. One day, I am going to become a wizard, and rule the world in a magical dictatorship. That hasn't happened yet, so I bide my time by wasting it on video games and anime. It'll happen eventually though. If I had to give myself one serious goal, it would to find something I enjoy doing, and then be successful at it. I also really like Shrek.</p>
